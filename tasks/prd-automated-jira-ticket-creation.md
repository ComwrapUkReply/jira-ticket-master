# Product Requirements Document: Automated Jira Ticket Creation

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a Python script that automates the creation of Jira tickets from a client-provided Word document. The primary goal is to streamline the workflow for project managers, developers, and QA personnel by eliminating manual data entry, reducing human error, and accelerating the process of populating the Jira project backlog.

## 2. Goals

*   **Efficiency:** Significantly reduce the time and effort required to transfer issues from a Word document into Jira.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure a 1:1 mapping of issues from the document to Jira tickets, preserving the original title and description.
*   **Usability:** Provide a simple, command-line-based tool that is easy for technical users (PMs, Devs, QA) to operate.
*   **Reliability:** Develop a robust script with clear error handling for predictable failure cases.

## 3. User Stories

*   **As a Project Manager,** I want to run a single command to automatically convert a list of issues from a client's Word document into Jira tickets, so that I can quickly populate our project backlog without manual data entry.
*   **As a Developer,** I want to use the script to process feedback documents and create trackable tasks in Jira, so I can focus on development work instead of administrative tasks.
*   **As a QA Engineer,** I want to quickly log bugs from a test report document into Jira, so that the development team can address them promptly.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  The system **must** accept a local Word document (`.docx`) as input.
2.  The script **must** parse the document, identifying separate issues based on them being separated by double newlines.
3.  Each parsed issue **must** be structured into a "title" (the first line of a block) and a "description" (all subsequent lines in the block).
4.  The system **must** require four command-line arguments: Jira server URL, username, API token, and the Jira project key.
5.  The system **must** establish a secure, authenticated session with the specified Jira server.
6.  For each parsed issue, the system **must** create a new Jira ticket with the issue type 'Task'.
7.  The parsed `title` **must** be used as the Jira ticket's 'Summary'.
8.  The parsed `description` **must** be used as the Jira ticket's 'Description'.
9.  The script **must** print the key of each successfully created Jira ticket to the console (e.g., "Successfully created issue: PROJ-123").
10. The script **must** implement error handling for:
    *   Invalid or missing command-line arguments.
    *   The specified Word document not being found.
    *   Incorrect Jira credentials or insufficient permissions.
    *   Network connectivity issues with the Jira server.
11. In case of an error, the script **must** print a clear, user-friendly error message to the console and terminate gracefully.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

*   This version will **not** support input formats other than `.docx`.
*   This version will **not** update, modify, or delete existing Jira tickets.
*   This version will **not** automatically assign the created tickets to specific users.
*   This version will **not** allow for specifying custom Jira fields beyond 'Summary', 'Description', 'Project', and 'Issuetype'.
*   This version will **not** support parsing Word documents with complex formatting like tables, images, or nested lists.

## 6. Technical Considerations

*   The script will be developed in Python 3.
*   It is designed for command-line execution.
*   Key dependencies are `python-docx` and `jira`.
*   A `venv` should be used to manage dependencies.
*   Credentials will be passed via command-line arguments to avoid storing them in the source code.

## 7. Success Metrics

*   The script runs without errors when provided with valid inputs.
*   It accurately parses 100% of issues from a correctly formatted Word document.
*   A corresponding Jira ticket is created for 100% of the parsed issues.
*   The time to create tickets for a document with 10+ issues is reduced by at least 90% compared to the manual process.

## 8. Open Questions

*   Should the default Jira issue type be configurable (e.g., 'Bug', 'Story') instead of hardcoded as 'Task'?
*   What is the desired behavior if the script is run multiple times on the same input file? Should it create duplicate tickets?
