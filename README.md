## Setup and Installation

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Python 3
-   A Jira account with API token permissions

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

`git clone <repository-url>`
`cd <repository-directory>`

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

`python3 -m venv venv`

### 4. Activate the Environment

-   **On macOS/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`
-   **On Windows:** `.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate`

### 5. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 6. Configure Credentials (Optional but Recommended)

To avoid entering your Jira credentials every time:

1. **Copy the configuration template:**
   `cp config.template.py config.py`

2. **Edit the config.py file:**
   - Replace `YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual Jira API token
   - Update the server URL and username if different
   - Save the file

3. **Generate a Jira API Token:**
   - Go to https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
   - Click "Create API token"
   - Give it a label (e.g., "Jira Automation Tool")
   - Copy the generated token and paste it in `config.py`

4. **Configure OpenAI API (Optional - for AI-powered analysis):**
   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Click "Create new secret key"
   - Copy the API key and add it to `config.py` under `OPENAI_CONFIG["api_key"]`
   - This enables AI-powered document analysis for better task extraction

**Note:** The `config.py` file is automatically ignored by git to keep your credentials secure.

## How to Use

You can create Jira tickets using either the Graphical User Interface (GUI) or the Command-Line Interface (CLI).

### Option 1: Using the Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The GUI is the easiest way to use this tool, especially for non-technical users.

1.  **Launch the application:**
    `python3 jira_ticket_gui.py`

2.  **Auto-populated fields:**
    -   If you've configured `config.py`, your Jira credentials will be automatically filled in
    -   The application will automatically fetch available projects on startup

3.  **Fill in any missing details:**
    -   **Jira Server URL:** Your Jira instance URL (auto-filled if configured)
    -   **Jira Username:** Your email address (auto-filled if configured)
    -   **API Token:** Your Jira API token (auto-filled if configured)

    -   **Epic:** Optionally select an epic to link the tickets to

4.  **Fetch Projects (if needed):**
    -   If projects aren't auto-loaded, click **üîÑ Fetch Projects** to load available projects
    -   Select your target project from the dropdown

5.  **Fetch Epics (Optional):**
    -   After selecting a project, click the **üîÑ Fetch Epics** button to load available epics
    -   Select an epic from the dropdown if you want to link all created tickets to that epic

6.  **Choose Initial Status:**
    -   Select the initial status for created tickets from the **Initial Status** dropdown
    -   Click **üîÑ Fetch Statuses** to load project-specific statuses from Jira
    -   Common statuses include: To Do, In Progress, Done, Backlog, etc.

7.  **Choose Analysis Mode:**
    -   **AI-Powered**: Uses OpenAI to intelligently extract tasks from any document format (requires OpenAI API key)
    -   **Enhanced**: Extracts text and images from Word documents with improved parsing
    -   **Basic**: Simple text parsing for basic use cases

8.  **Preview Tickets:**
    -   Click **1Ô∏è‚É£ Preview Tickets** to see what tickets will be created from your document
    -   Review the preview in the console to ensure the parsing is correct
    -   AI-Powered mode will show priority, complexity, and category analysis

9.  **Select the Word Document:**
    -   Click the **Browse for Word Doc** button and choose the `.docx` file containing the issues

10. **Create Tickets:**
    -   Click the **2Ô∏è‚É£ Create in Jira** button. The progress will be displayed in the output console at the bottom

### Option 2: Using the Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI is ideal for technical users or for integrating into other scripts.

1.  **Run the script with the following command:**

    `python3 create_jira_tickets.py <server_url> <username> <api_token> <project_key>`

2.  **Replace the placeholders:**
    -   `<server_url>`: Your Jira instance URL.
    -   `<username>`: Your Jira email.
    -   `<api_token>`: Your Jira API token.
    -   `<project_key>`: The target Jira project key.

    **Example:**
    `python3 create_jira_tickets.py https://example.atlassian.net user@example.com YOUR_API_TOKEN MYPROJ`

## Word Document Formatting

For the script to parse issues correctly, your `.docx` file must follow a simple format:

-   Each issue must be separated by at least one empty line (a double newline).
-   The first line of an issue block will become the **ticket title (Summary)**.
-   All subsequent lines in that block will become the **ticket Description**.

### Example:

```
This is the title for the first issue.
This is the first line of the description.
This is the second line of the description.

This is the title for the second issue.
This description only has one line.
``` 

## AI-Powered Document Analysis

### **For Enhanced/Basic Analysis:** 

For the script to parse issues correctly, your `.docx` file must follow a simple format:

-   Each issue must be separated by at least one empty line (a double newline).
-   The first line of an issue block will become the **ticket title (Summary)**.
-   All subsequent lines in that block will become the **ticket Description**.

### Example:

```
This is the title for the first issue.
This is the first line of the description.
This is the second line of the description.

This is the title for the second issue.
This description only has one line.
```
